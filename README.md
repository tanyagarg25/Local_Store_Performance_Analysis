**Project Title:**

Local Store Performance Analysis

**Executive Summary**

**Objective:**

The goal of this project is to analyze and enhance the performance of local stores by examining sales data and key performance indicators (KPIs). The project aims to identify trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for growth, offering actionable insights to optimize store operations and improve profitability.

**Context:**

The analysis uses sales data from multiple local stores, with visualizations created using Tableau and basic statistical analysis performed in Excel. The focus is on understanding store performance through various metrics such as sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.

**Business Problem**

**Problem Identification:**

Local stores are facing challenges in optimizing their operations and improving profitability. The lack of detailed performance insights hinders their ability to make data-driven decisions that could enhance sales and operational efficiency.

**Business Impact:**

Addressing these performance issues is critical for boosting store profitability, improving customer satisfaction, and making informed strategic decisions. Understanding the factors affecting store performance can lead to better inventory management, targeted marketing strategies, and enhanced customer experiences.

**Methodology**

**Data Cleaning & Transformation:**

Cleaned sales data to remove inconsistencies and outliers.
Standardized date formats and ensured accurate categorization of store performance metrics.
Aggregated data at different levels (e.g., daily, weekly) to identify trends and patterns.

**Analysis Techniques:**

Descriptive Statistics: Calculated basic statistics such as mean, median, and variance for sales and customer metrics.
Trend Analysis: Used Tableau to create time series visualizations, revealing sales trends and seasonal variations.
Performance Comparison: Generated dashboards to compare performance across different stores and identify top-performing and underperforming locations.
Skills

**Tools, Languages, & Software:**

Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing performance metrics.
Excel: For initial data cleaning, statistical summaries, and additional analysis.
Results & Business Recommendations

**Business Impact:**
